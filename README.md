# Quarantine Art Collective

Here's a place for us to host things we made during the quarantine.

## Step 1: Format the content
Stuff on the page will be displayed with a really basic formatting language called markdown. (This page itself is actually rendered in markdown)

To format your text, images, or links to any content, you can write it in markdown. If it looks good here, [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io), it'll look good on the site.

Here's a markdown cheatsheet: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

If you edit your page on [dillinger](https://dillinger.io), you can directly download your finished file there! When you're good to go: click `Export As -> Markdown`


## Step 2: Publishing
- Send your markdown file to James with a **title** and **time & date**.

 **OR** 

- make a pull request to this repo.
