By S.E. FitzGerald

It was a foggy day in San Francisco the day Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ returned to earth. Derryck Jenkins was riding the Google Bus to work when he saw the notification on his phone. It read as follows:

**FOX NEWS REPORTS THE SECOND COMING OF JESUS IN MEXICO CITY**

Derryck’s initial thought was that it must be a hoax. He had been raised sort-of Catholic—he had gotten all the necessary sacraments—but he knew his folks were never really that into it, especially that one time Father Julian told the congregation they couldn’t in good conscience vote Democrat because of the abortion thing. Derryck’s father Wendell made a show of not showing up to mass till Christmas after that.  

His second thought was it actually made sense that if Jesus were to make his first public appearance in two millennia, it would be in Mexico City seeing as it has the largest population of any greater metropolitan area in any majority-Christian country (he had once Googled that out of curiosity). It also made sense that Fox News was reporting it. So, in a sense, it checked out. 
Wondering if other people had heard the news, Derryck looked around the bus. Everyone seemed to be going about their business as usual. Either they hadn’t heard or didn’t care. 

The article was accompanied by a video showing a man dressed in what looked like J. Crew business casual floating a few hundred feet above the Paseo de la Reforma. It was a shitty cellphone video that zoomed in on the floating man as the narrator exclaimed, “Jesucristo, ¿qué diablos es eso?” The floating man didn’t say anything. It was hard to tell from far away but he seemed to be smiling. He was holding a piece of paper like the ones chauffeurs hold at the airport that read, “I am Jesus, your Lord and Savior.” It had clearly been written in Magic Marker. 

Derryck couldn’t help it. He pissed himself in his seat. The woman sitting next to him immediately noticed the trickle coming down the seat and looked away in disgust, pursing her lips and shaking her head. 

He showed her his phone to save face. 
>“No, look at this story. Apparently the Second Coming is happening right now.”

>“What the hell do you mean, the Second Coming? Where?”

>“Mexico City.”

>“Shit, I’m a fucking Buddhist,” the woman said, her mild-mannered appearance betraying her potty mouth. “Does this mean I’m totally fucked?”

>“No more than me, last time I went to mass was Easter 1997,” Derryck lied (he had been to mass as recently as Christmas, he actually kind of liked the singing part), trying to comfort her. 

He figured it was his duty at this point to alert the entire bus to the return of Christ, so he went up to the bus driver and let him know. The driver was a stoic man who told him, 
>“Man, sit your crazy ass back down and let me focus on driving this bus!”

>“No, really, they have a video and everything.” Derryck shoved it in the driver’s face. Eckhard (his nametag read) glanced at it, then back at the road, then back at the phone once he realized what he was seeing.

>“Man, I knew Jesus was a brother!”

He pulled over the bus over. “As of this very moment, I am no longer your bus driver, I am just a brother to y’all in Christ’s eternal kingdom! Woohoo!” 

Eckhard ran out of the bus and down the street, never to be seen again. 

The enhanced border security of the current administration made the pilgrimage from the Bible Belt to the Mexican capital difficult. The president appeared on television and said that he had opened up a line of communication with Jesus, who had descended to ground level and begun healing the sick of the city by the time Derryck saw the video. He said he was arranging with the Mexican government an orderly system for anyone who wanted to cross the border so they could get in line to be judged by The Everlasting Father. The president said he would be offering preference to Christians, which turned out to be difficult in practice. 

The first person who was damned to hell caused a media ruckus. The video of the balding middle-aged Mexican man who had evidently sinned one too many times (Derryck thought he looked like a pedophile anyway) getting struck with a ball of light from Jesus’ chest went viral. All that remained of the man was his glasses lying on the pavement beneath his feet where he had been standing just moments before, unaware he would be the first person to receive eternal damnation from The Prince of Peace, live on CNN. 

Those who were granted entry to heaven by a wave of Jesus’ hand were free to go. There was no such dramatic ball of light for them, they were just told to go about their business as usual until the Eternal Kingdom was ready at which time they would receive a text from God Himself alerting them to the good news. 

It was extremely difficult to determine who was actually a practicing Christian and who was agnostic but still wanted to hedge their bets and see if they would get to heaven. Thousands of Americans showed up at the Mexican border waving signed letters from their priest or pastor demanding that they be allowed to make the pilgrimage. 

After a few days of this sort of confusion the administration and the Mexican government agreed to just open the border; the full force of the American evangelical community was not to be reckoned with. The president was a Republican and he wasn’t about to alienate his base by standing between them and their Savior a year and a half before reelection. 

And after the first American pilgrim got on the wrong side of a cartel sicario on the road to Mexico City and ended up strung from a Joshua tree, the president had no choice but to send the National Guard to guarantee safe passage for American citizens. 

Once reliable reports started coming out of Mexico about the actual rates of damnation, however, the stream of pilgrims slowed considerably. It turned out that two-thirds of those who went to see Jesus were getting zapped and disappearing. He said these people were being teleported to hell. There wasn’t any actual proof of this, but it was clear that they were no longer alive on earth in any orthodox sense. So, after the initial wave of humanity descended on Mexico, only the most devout and certain of their salvation remained on the trail to the capital. 

Derryck Jenkins wasn’t ready to put it all on the line, so he decided to stay home. He continued to go to work like normal; while much of the economy of the Bible Belt had understandably grinded to a halt, the coastal cities were pretty much business as usual since most yuppies were either unbelievers to begin with or wanted to act like everything was still normal until it was absolutely clear that the world was ending. 

There was one important fact that was the subject of much debate on television, Twitter, and various places of congregation across the world: The Second Coming simply was not happening the way the Bible said it would. According to the literature, Jesus was not supposed to actually come back to earth and walk among mortal men for an extended period of time. The working narrative in the Catholic Church that he was supposed to basically snap his fingers, thereby simultaneously raising the dead, defeating the Antichrist, rendering his final judgment on extant humanity and cutting the ribbon in front of New Jerusalem. Evidently, however, he was not following his divine directive to a tee. There appeared to be no visible Antichrist, and the dead had not yet been raised. 

Whether or not the current occupant of the Vatican believed in papal infallibility, it was obvious to him and everyone else that Jesus was his superior, and not his subordinate, in the divine corporate hierarchy. This meant that the pope didn’t have the balls to ask Jesus directly why he hadn’t raised the dead yet. In fact, he refused to even broach the subject in the press. His main talking point was something about how divine revelation is not always totally accurate. Since the source texts were written by mortal men, there could ostensibly be some serious factual errors within them, either due to bad translations or simple exaggeration. 

When it came to the peculiar fashion in which the Second Coming seemed to be playing out, one pundit put it this way: “I’ve never been a religious man, so I’ve being thinking about alternate theories. It’s like what would happen if aliens from another galaxy wanted to simulate the Final Judgment to enslave our species but they didn’t do their homework, so they ended up screwing it up a bit. Obviously, that’s pretty far-fetched so I’m not necessarily saying I think that is what’s going on. All I’m saying is, if that did happen, this is what it would probably look like.”

Derryck saw this commentary live on his favorite morning show a few weeks after Jesus returned. Far-fetched, sure, he thought, but he does have a point. Clearly the people who are getting damned to hell are totally fucked whether that’s actually the Savior or not. Either they’re actually going to hell or they’re simply being incinerated on the spot. Both bad options. But it’s the people who are being given a ticket to heaven that are interesting, Derryck posited as he poured himself more coffee. What if instead of eternal salvation, they’re getting a one-way ticket to some menagerie in galaxy billions of light-years away, where they’ll be doomed to do nothing but consume, defecate and procreate forever for the amusement of an alien species?

A nutty hypothesis, sure. But scientifically sounder, perhaps, than believing that a raggedy man in Mexico City was actually the Son of God (whose existence had no empirical foundation whatsoever). Derryck suspected most sane scientists would agree that however unlikely it might seem, the theory espoused by the notorious cultural critic on the morning show and now being seriously considered by Derryck himself was at least equally as if not more likely than what the situation looked like at face value. And when it all boiled down, what was the difference anyway, if you were damned? Either it was really God, or this alien race with a limited knowledge of Christianity, as it were, was humanity’s new flesh-and-blood Pantheon. Obviously, there was a huge difference for those who went to heaven, but if Derryck thought he was not worthy, he figured he was screwed either way. 

Then he thought about it more and realized it was actually in his interest for it to be aliens. In that case, he would simply be killed, and that would be it—fade to black. Death of an atheist. Worm food. Those smug Bible-thumpers would stop grinning, and wish they were dead, as soon as they realized they were being put in an intergalactic zoo. But if it was really Jesus, he would probably have to spend eternity in hell, or at least a few millennia in Purgatory if that was still a thing. 

Derryck was still on the fence at this point. He figured the odds might as well be fifty-fifty. Both theories, if you could conscionably call either option a theory in the literal sense of a well-evidenced hypothesis, seemed equally wacky. He mulled this over for a week until he had another realization that pushed him toward the alien theory once and for all.
	
A bunch of the people who were getting into heaven were pieces of shit. 

He had been on Facebook more often than usual because there was a global trend of posting a selfie with Jesus if he decided to let you into heaven. Among the most famous inductees: 
1.	Barack Hussein and Mrs. Obama. Not a surprise to half the country but devastating to the other half who were as likely to think he was a Muslim as the Antichrist. While the former was clearly disproven, there was technically no passage in the Bible stipulating that Muslims couldn’t go to Christian heaven. 
2.	Caitlin Marie Jenner. A victory for the LGBT community, and another dagger in the heart of much of the Christian right.
3.	James Earl Carter Jr. A shoo-in. 
4.	Bashar Hafez Al-Assad. Was only able to enter Mexico after delicate diplomatic maneuvering. Widely considered one of the world’s most notorious living dictators and war criminals. 
5.	Henry Alfred Kissinger. A victory for the right, and an existential crisis for everyone else. 
6.	Joseph Rao Kony. How he was able to make it to Mexico without alerting the relevant authorities remains a mystery, as does how he could possibly deserve salvation. 

And among the most famous damned to hell:
1.	Kanye Omari and Mrs. Kardashian West. Extremely controversial in the press. 
2.	Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson. A humiliation for the Christian right but not a surprise to an equal number of folks.
3.	William Henry III and Mrs. Gates.  A national tragedy. They will be sorely missed. 
4.	Warren Edward Buffet. Why? Just why? our nation whispered into the air. 
5.	Joaquin Archivaldo Guzman Loera a.k.a. El Chapo. He had it coming.

There seemed to be basically no correlation between how virtuous these celebrities were and where they ended up. But, at least for those who seemed like decent people but ended up getting vaporized and sent to “hell,” Derryck considered that they could easily have a mean streak behind closed doors. Maybe Warren Buffet had been running a child sex ring, and Bill verbally abused Melinda behind closed doors. Of course, that didn’t explain the induction into heaven of the likes of Assad and Kony. 
What really did it for Derryck was anecdotal evidence of people he knew personally on Facebook. These were despicable human beings who posted selfies with Jesus with impunity, thanking him from the bottom of their hearts. These included:
1.	Derryck’s high school bully, who ran a cash-checking business and supposedly had beaten and cheated on his ex-wife. Now happily remarried with two kids who were purportedly also pieces of shit.
2.	Derryck’s great-uncle, whose Klan uniform Derryck had found in a closet during an ill-fated game of hide-and-seek as a child. 

Derryck didn’t know it at the time, but many other people were having this revelation at the same time as him, inspired by the man on the television. They, much like him, were also realizing that it was probably best to keep their prophecy to themselves. If this new theory was true, strategically speaking it probably wasn’t the best move to alert this alien posing as Jesus that they were onto him. Derryck didn’t have a long-term plan, but it was clear that the best thing to do in the short term was to lie low. If he didn’t make the pilgrimage, he was safe for the moment because he wouldn’t be vaporized by what was probably some sort of firearm up the Jesus-impostor’s sleeve, and he wouldn’t be put on the enslavement SMS mailing list that eager religious people were being added to everyday. 
	
So, for now, the thing to do was to make sure none of his friends and family went on the pilgrimage if possible, and to find other people who had also deducted what the aliens were up to so they could start forming a resistance. For all he knew, the aliens could be watching his every move, like Big Brother but with better tech. Even if that weren’t true it wasn’t worth risking alerting the invaders that he had figured out their plan. He would have to be extremely careful, and would have to convince his devout grandparents not to go to Mexico City without telling them why.
